Installation scripts for my Ubuntu installation.

## Installation
For the installation Ubuntu 20.10+ is needed, since the package polybar requirs that.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jorisperrenet/iscripts.git && cd iscripts
./install.sh
```

For a complete step-by-step process to set up everything, see the `INSTALL.md` file.

## Programs
All programs listed in `progs.csv` are installed automatically through the `install.sh` script.

Programs in `manual_install` are installed via a custom script in that directory.
